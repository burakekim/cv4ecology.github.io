									<p>
									Each student in the school will be working hands-on to build a computer vision prototype to help efficiently answer
									their own ecological research question. Students are expected to propose this project as part of their application materials,
									and clearly define the question they hope to answer, the data they plan to use, and the broader impacts of their work if successful.

									</p>

									<p>

									Deadline for applications: December 1, 2021, applications recieved after the deadline may not be considered.

									</p>


									<h3>Application Materials</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>1-page project proposal (11pt font, 1" margins) addressing the following: </li>
										<ul>
											<li>Research problem -- What question are you interested in and how would computer vision methods better enable you to address it?</li>
											<li>Data -- What data do you plan to work with? Do you have the data already in hand? How much data do you have, how much will you have by the time the summer school will start? Is the data labeled already, or do you need to develop a labeling plan?</li>
											<li>Motivation -- What would success look like? What is the likely impact of your research for science, policy, education and conservation?</li>
										</ul>
										<li>1-page personal statement (11pt font, 1" margins) describing your accomplishments, skills and career objectives.</li>
										<li>Programming example (ie a github repository for a project, can be Python or R).</li>
										<li>One letter of reference</li>
										<li>CV</li>
										<li>5â€™  video with a presentation of their work and their proposed project</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
									Application materials will be uploaded via a portal with letters of reference submitted directly by the writer, details to come by early November.
									</p>
									<h3>Target school participants</h3>
									<ul>
									  <li>Senior graduate students, postdocs, early faculty, junior researchers in Ecology and Conservation. </li>
									  <li>Facility with computer programming for data analysis, preference for Python (we will help participants self-assess and we will provide links to Python tutorials that participants will be required to attend before coming to Caltech if they do not have pre-existing python proficiency).</li>
									  <li>A demonstrated interest in academic research in ecology and conservation. A record of published research on quantitative ecology and conservation is preferred.</li>
								          <li>An ecology/conservation question in mind with access to a large image/video dataset and need for CV/ML methods to support such research. We will work with accepted applicants in the months leading up to the school to curate and label their datasets for computer vision. </li>
									  <li>Scientists from communities facing large conservation challenges and from minoritized communities are especially encouraged to apply.</li>
									</ul>
