										<h4>Sara Beery</h4>
								        <p class="bio">
								        	Sara Beery has always been passionate about the natural world, and she saw a need for technology-based approaches to conservation and sustainability challenges. This led her to pursue a PhD at Caltech, where her research focuses on computer vision for global-scale biodiversity monitoring. Her work is funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a PIMCO Data Science Fellowship, and an Amazon AI4Science Fellowship. She works closely with Microsoft AI for Earth and Google Research to translate her work into usable tools. Sara’s experiences as a professional ballerina, a queer woman, and a nontraditional student has taught her the value of unique and diverse perspectives in the research community. She’s passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM through mentorship and outreach.

										<h4>Pietro Perona</h4>
										<p class="bio">
											Professor Perona's research focuses on vision: how do we see and how can we build machines that see. He is currently interested visual recognition, more specifically visual categorization. He is studying how machines can learn to recognize frogs, cars, faces and trees with minimal human supervision, and how machines can learn from human experts. His project 'Visipedia' has produced two smart device apps (iNaturalist and Merlin Bird ID) that anyone can use to recognize the species of plants and animals from a photograph.

											<br/><br/>
											In collaboration with Professors Anderson and Dickinson, Professor Perona is building vision systems and statistical techniques for measuring actions and activities in fruit flies and mice. This enables geneticists and neuroethologists to investigate the relationship between genes, brains and behavior.

											<br/><br/>
											Professor Perona is also interested in studying how humans perform visual tasks, such as searching and recognizing image content. One of his recent projects studies how to harness the visual ability of thousands of people on the web.

										<h4>Elijah Cole</h4>
										<p class="bio">
											Elijah is a Computing and Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. student in the Computational Vision Group at Caltech, advised by Pietro Perona. He's also involved in the Visipedia project. He's interested in computer vision, machine learning, and using these techniques to enable scientific progress in ecology and medicine. His work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

										<h4>Jason Parham</h4>
										<p class="bio">
											Jason is a Senior Computer Vision Research Engineer at WildMe. He received his B.S. in Computer Science / Mathematics from Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA in 2008 and holds a 2015 M.S. in Computer Science from RPI in Troy, NY. Jason is finishing his Ph.D. under the advising of Dr. Charles Stewart in the Computer Vision research group at RPI.

											<br/><br/>
											Jason’s Masters thesis was on the design and implementation of a citizen science-powered photographic censusing of the zebra and giraffe in the Nairobi National Park. His current doctoral research focuses on object detection and classification, using deep learning on wildlife imagery, to power photographic censusing. Jason is a co-developer of Wildbook‘s Image Analysis components, which are used to monitor animal populations in conservancies around Kenya and which integrate with the Wildbook data management platform. Previously, Jason worked three years for Kitware, Inc. in Clifton Park on detecting vehicles and military aircraft in overhead satellite imagery. His work at Kitware led to the development of KWCNN, a customized Python module that enables easy training of deep learning networks such as Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) and Generative Autoencoder Networks (GANs).

										<h4>Benjamin Kellenberger</h4>
										<p class="bio">
											Benjamin is a researcher with Devis Tuia at the ECEO lab of EPFL, Sion, Switzerland. He works in the fields of Remote Sensing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. His focus is primarily on animal conservation from above—using aerial imagery from airplanes, drones, etc. and machine-based tools to efficiently identify, count, and with that protect endangered animal species.
