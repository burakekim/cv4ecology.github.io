										<h4>Sara Beery</h4>
								        <p class="bio">
								        	Sara Beery has always been passionate about the natural world, and she saw a need for technology-based approaches to conservation and sustainability challenges. This led her to pursue a PhD at Caltech, where her research focuses on computer vision for global-scale biodiversity monitoring. Her work is funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a PIMCO Data Science Fellowship, and an Amazon AI4Science Fellowship. She works closely with Microsoft AI for Earth and Wildlife Insights (via Google Research) to translate her work into usable tools. Sara’s experiences as a professional ballerina, a queer woman, and a nontraditional student have taught her the value of unique and diverse perspectives in the research community. She’s passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM through mentorship, teaching, and outreach.

										<h4>Pietro Perona</h4>
										<p class="bio">
											Professor Perona's research focuses on vision: how do we see and how can we build machines that see. He is currently interested visual recognition, more specifically visual categorization. He is studying how machines can learn to recognize frogs, cars, faces and trees with minimal human supervision, and how machines can learn from human experts. His project 'Visipedia' has produced two smart device apps (iNaturalist and Merlin Bird ID) that anyone can use to recognize the species of plants and animals from a photograph.

											<br/><br/>
											In collaboration with Professors Anderson and Dickinson, Professor Perona is building vision systems and statistical techniques for measuring actions and activities in fruit flies and mice. This enables geneticists and neuroethologists to investigate the relationship between genes, brains and behavior.
											Professor Perona is also interested in studying how humans perform visual tasks, such as searching and recognizing image content.

										<h4>Jason Parham</h4>
										<p class="bio">
											Jason Parham is a senior research engineer at Wild Me and works to apply the latest machine learning and computer vision algorithms in wildlife applications.  Jason holds a B.S. in Computer Science / Mathematics from Pepperdine University (2008), M.S. in Computer Science from RPI (2015), and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from RPI (2021; advisor <a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~stewart/">Dr. Charles Stewart</a>).  Jason's doctoral research on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=18vVhS8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">"Animal Detection for Photographic Censusing"</a> complements his applied work at Wild Me and offers a robust, end-to-end system for building large animal ID databases for conservation.  Jason is also the co-developer and current maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia">Wildbook's Image Analysis (WBIA)</a> Python toolkit.  The machine learning algorithms available in WBIA are used to detect, classify, ID, and catalog animal populations worldwide and are available open-source on GitHub, PyPI, and as a pre-configured Docker container.
