										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a PhD Candidate in Biological Anthropology/Primatology at the CUNY Graduate Center (born-and-raised New Yorker as well!). I study black-and-white ruffed lemur vocalizations and how passive acoustic monitoring and machine learning can be used in conservation efforts for this Critically Endangered species. I conduct this research in the southeastern Madagascar rainforests in collaboration with Centre ValBio research station. I also co-maintain the <a href="https://conservationtech.directory/">Conservation Tech Directory</a> website. I have a B.S. in Animal Science from Cornell University and a M.S. in Primate Behavior from Central Washington University. When I'm not wearing my PhD hat, I love to horseback ride, hike and will the NY Giants & Arsenal to win. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> I use passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to survey ruffed lemur populations in southeastern Madagascar. I’m deploying PAM recorders (Audiomoths) at sites across a 120km rainforest corridor where little to no research has taken place since the 1980s and for which we don’t know the distribution lemurs. For the CV4E school, I’ll be using machine learning to automatically detect/pick out ruffed lemur calls in spectrograms (2-D image representations of sound) from my long-term PAM recordings. These detections, combined with the spatial layout (GPS) of the devices, can then be used to model lemur distribution and range in the corridor. This will contribute to the next species census and help identify sites to prioritize for future conservation initiatives.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Catherine Breen is a PhD student and NASA Fellow at the University of Washington. She is on the pursuit to use computer science to advance ecology and the wellbeing of wildlife in a changing climate. Her work is supported by NASA, the American Scandinavian Foundation, and Microsoft’s AI for Earth Program. Before coming to UW, Catherine was a remote sensing analyst at NASA Ames Research Center, and the first Energy and Climate Fellow at The Wilderness Society. Believing the best way to understand nature’s complexities is through experience, she thru-hiked the full Pacific Crest Trail in 2019. Catherine Breen has an Ecology and Evolutionary Biology degree from Princeton University.

											<b>Project:</b> Changing snow conditions are likely to have a major impact on northern wildlife, but climate change research has focused far more on changing temperatures than precipitation and snow.  Warm winters have increased the frequency of midwinter rain events, when rain falls on snow, and these events can create an icy layer, restricting vegetation access for grazers, or melt the snow completely, reducing energetic costs for winter movement. Using a 1000+ camera trap network in Norway, this project will develop a computer vision model that distinguishes rain from snow, and, by incorporating a model that detects snow cover, when it is raining on snow. Distinguishing between rain and snow in wildlife images will accelerate our ability to track rain, snow, rain on snow trends, and subsequent wildlife and biodiversity impacts.

										<i>University of Victoria/BearID Project</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Victoria, Canada, within the Applied Conservation Science Lab. I am also a co-founder of the BearID Project, a non-profit research organisation that develops non-invasive technologies to research and monitor bears and other wildlife. My academic interests focus on the social behaviour of bears, particularly research into olfactory communication. I am especially interested in the application of conservation technology to advance field techniques for large carnivore research. Through my applied work, I collaborate with First Nations to aid the inclusion of Western science in wildlife management decisions. I also work closely with ecotourism operators in British Columbia to assess and reduce impacts of commercial viewing on wildlife. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> I am interested in automated methods of individual ID for species that lack unique markings. Bears are difficult to research and monitor as they are elusive, inhabit a wide variety of habitats, have large home-ranges, and generally don’t possess stable markings that can be used to identify individuals. Collectively, this restricts the tools and techniques available to study and conserve them. Manual individual ID of unmarked species requires species-specific expertise, population-specific training, and is an extremely time-consuming process. My project will use four years of camera trap data (20 second, 1080p videos) from coastal British Columbia to develop a classification model for individual ID of brown (grizzly) bears using a facial recognition approach. This model would represent the first automated tool for individual ID developed using camera trap imagery for any bear species.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Rowan is a PhD student in Geography and Environmental Studies at the University of New Mexico. After spending the early part of her career working as a wildlife technician on endangered species monitoring and recovery programs in Arizona and New Mexico, she pivoted into GIScience to learn how to leverage emerging geospatial tools for wildlife conservation and management. She also supports a variety of imaging and LiDAR collection projects as the UAS pilot for the ASPIRE Center at UNM. In her spare time, she enjoys exploring the beautiful landscapes of the American Southwest through running, cycling, paddleboarding, and cross-country skiing.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Rowan is working with the US Fish and Wildlife Service as the project manager for “Drones for Ducks”, a collaborative project with the aim of automating the annual migratory waterfowl census at federal wildlife refuges in the Southwest Region. The program is developing a framework for surveying waterfowl with UAS and deriving automated population counts through machine learning. The project has been certified on the citizen science platform Zooniverse and has collected over 200,000 image labels since May 2021; to participate or learn more, visit the project site: <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/rowan-aspire/drones-for-ducks">Drones for Ducks</a>.

										<i>Imperial College London</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Natalie is a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London, where she studies the behavioral ecology of leaf-cutter ants. Ants form societies that rival our own, and her research focuses on how they have coordinated complex behaviors to become dominant members of our planet. She holds a B.S. in Biology and Evolutionary Anthropology from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in Entomology from Pennsylvania State University. During her doctoral work studying the behavior of fungal-infected ‘zombie ants’, she developed an interest in computational methods for studying behavior. Broadly, she is passionate about preserving biodiversity and making science accessible for all.  
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Leaf-cutter ants form some of the largest and most complex social insect colonies, as millions of individuals work together to maintain a symbiotic fungus grown for food. Workers vary massively in size within a colony, but studying size variation proves tedious without automated methods. I aim to develop a scale-independent size detection tool that allows recognition of different sized workers in the field, as well as detects the leaf fragments they are carrying. This will improve our ability to study a major pest of the Neotropics, as well as improve monitoring of their consumption of different plants.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a third year PhD student here at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Sciences. My research involves studying interactions between human and natural systems through a suite of remote sensors. I am particularly interested in areas of data fusion and applying causal inference methods to better understand how we are affecting the landscape and vice versa. I hope to incorporate machine learning into my projects broadly. When I'm not working, you can find me surfing, fly-fishing, or on a long bike ride.

											<b>Project:</b> My Summer CV project involves tracking bats in California's Central Valley using NEXRAD Doppler Weather Radar. My ultimate goal is seeing where these bats are spending time over the course of various time scales, from a single evening to decades, and exploring the relationship between where bats forage for pests and agricultural pesticide use.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											In my PhD project at Aarhus University, I develop methods for detecting interactions between flowers and pollinators using image-based monitoring, deep learning, and computer vision. More broadly, my interests are in developing technical solutions for automated nature monitoring to help us understand natural processes and how they are affected by e.g. climate change. I love turning an idea into a working product and will often use my skills in coding, electronics, CAD and 3D printing to get there. I strongly believe that interdisciplinary collaboration between ecology and engineering will move both fields forward.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In my project, I will test how well CNNs can detect and classify insect species that are morphologically different but belong to the same order. Deep learning methods are increasingly being applied in insect monitoring, but published insect detection models are generally confined to few species and are therefore very site-specific and not broadly applicable. At the same time, the laborious process of collecting and labelling sufficient amounts of training data and the computational power required to train CNNs may prevent ecologists from leveraging their power. The aim of this project is a publicly available, open source, generic insect detector.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Coming from a town known for the mysterious cases of children killed by wolves, was drawn towards wildlife conservation after witnessing a pangolin trade incident. What started as a volunteering stint in wildlife awareness activities a decade back became a full-time involvement over the years in wildlife research and conservation activities. Was fortunate to have been part of the Nature Conservation Foundation’s IUCN ITHCP project in southern India where I contributed for outreach, applied conservation and wildlife corridor monitoring projects. With Chevening Leadership scholarship, I completed my MSc in Applied Ecology and Conservation from the University of EastAnglia in 2020 and now leading team for Tech4Conservation at the Habitats Trust.

											<b>Project:</b> To explore the possibility of developing computer vision models for smartphone users while driving vehicle to help detect wild animals crossing road or waiting at the edge of the road. The broader idea is to establish a framework which enables collection of animal crossing behaviour on any road using a smartphone. Road networks are expanding at an alarming rate, cutting into pristine wildlife habitats and increasing wildlife-vehicle encounters, this approach will increase the data availability on such incidents and would help us in identifying sensitive road segments for wildlife crossings and prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am Francesca, I am a grad student in biology at Caltech studying neurobiology in fruit flies. I study flight control mechanisms flies use to maintain stable flight. Previously, I worked on a series of release-recapture experiments in the Mojave Desert studying how flies disperse in an open area. I grew up in Quito, Ecuador, then traveled to Florida for college at the University of Florida. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Long-distance dispersal is difficult to study in small insects, but with advances in remote sensor technologies, it is now possible to detect insects flying close to the ground. We performed release-and-recapture experiments using Drosophila and collected data to census the directional distribution of the flies as they disperse from a release site using sky-facing cameras. I seek to apply computer vision methods to these datasets to count the number of flies in each frame and track their trajectories as they move through the camera frame. This will inform existing models of how flies perform long-distance navigation, specially how they choose their initial headings while dispersing in an open landscape.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Rachel grew up in rural southwest Florida, in the heart of orange and cattle-country. After graduating from college in 2008, she began a three-mile-per-hour tour—on foot—of the subtle and dramatic shifts of vegetation across the American landscape, hiking over 10,500 miles on National Scenic Trails. Rachel is a doctoral student at the Yale School of the Environment. She is fascinated by how soils translate climate into vegetation in drylands, and her favorite drylands are big sagebrush ecosystems. She is excited by the potential for combining traditional field data with artificial intelligence to answer fundamental and applied questions about plant community ecology.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In rangelands, gradients of grazing intensity and disturbance form around water sources, with the greatest (and most visible) impacts close to the source, termed the “piosphere”. Ranching practices draw upon a suite of attractants (including artificial water sources) to achieve more even use of forage across the landscape. Yet, data sources for these attractants are incomplete and inaccurate. My project will use computer vision to detect piospheres in Wyoming using aerial imagery. This project will provide critical data to identify water- and livestock-remote areas, with important applications for land management, conservation, and sample design for research (like mine) that addresses fundamental questions about the interacting roles of environmental factors and disturbance in determining dryland plant community structure and function.

											I am Felix Rustemeyer, a dutch-german graduate student from Maastricht University in the Netherlands. After conducting a bachelors in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, I am now finishing my masters in Data Science for Decision Making. Inspired by a minor in Geomatics during an exchange in Sweden, I have grown a passion for employing the power of deep learning and computer vision for raising awareness and tackling the issues of our time. In an internship role at the Stockholm Environment Institute, I have conducted this last semester by using deep learning for identifying the impact of permafrost thaw. I am honored to be part of the inaugural cohort of the CV4Ecology summer school and am extremely excited for August!
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Thawing permafrost is a huge problem as permafrost soils are heavily carbon rich and is therefore causing large amounts of GHG emissions, while being absent from many international dialogues and strategies aimed at tackling climate change. The Stockholm Environment Institute has established a cross-sector collaboration to fill in this knowledge gap. The goal of this project is to identify landscape indications of thawing permafrost in the arctic using computer vision and satellite imagery. By identifying and monitoring these landscape indications in the form of thaw slumps, the extent, increase and the impact on climate caused by thawing permafrost in the arctic can be estimated.

											I am an analyst and field coordinator for the University of Montana Spatial Analysis Lab in. After earning my Bachelors degree in Environmental Studies from University of Vermont in 2019, I worked on geospatial scientific computing and imaging spectroscopy at Arizona State University. My work there involved mapping coral reefs, foliar functional trait mapping, and survey design for marine biodiversity monitoring. I then spent a winter season working with Glacier National Park's Citizen Science program helping to create wildlife surveys and analytical products for improving park management and visitor experience. I am interested in spatial ecology, land system science, algorithm development, and machine learning.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> We are working to characterize woodland draws and ravines across a huge area of Eastern Montana and the Dakotas in conjunction with the Bureau of Land Management. These systems are critical for wildlife and grazing, and are vital to the health of the region and function of its agriculture industry. These systems are particularly difficult to monitor due to their narrow, dendritic shape, so we will be using computer vision methods and remote sensing to develop a scalable monitoring protocol.

											I am a quantitative ecologist and Presidential Postdoc Fellow in EEB at Michigan State University (as of August 2022). My research uses a range of quantitative approaches that synthesize large-scale data streams to address both basic and applied questions in population and community ecology. I seek to understand how and why ecological systems are responding to rapid climatic change and what this might tell us regarding how best to conserve these systems. I have a particular interest in the timing of seasonal events (phenology), population dynamics, and biodiversity.

											<b>Project:</b> The Pacific walrus is an important benthic predator in Arctic marine ecosystems and a species of substantial cultural and economic importance to many Indigenous Arctic coastal communities. As a result of increasing pressures associated with global change, the future of this species is highly uncertain. I aim to develop a deep learning-based classifier to identify walrus in satellite imagery. This will serve as the basis for large-scale, automated efforts to monitor the distribution and abundance of this species and will provide stakeholders with information needed to make timely conservation management decisions.
