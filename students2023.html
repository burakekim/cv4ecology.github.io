											I'm a PhD student in the Ocean Sciences department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My doctoral research focuses on using computational methods to estimate the rates at which carbon is cycled in the ocean, but I'm broadly interested in applying data-driven methods to solve problems in the natural environment. Before venturing into oceanography, I studied civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> The ocean influences the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, partly due to a network of biologically mediated processes known as the biological carbon pump. Photosynthetic algae fix CO2 into biomass in the surface ocean. As algal cells collide and coalesce into aggregates or are repackaged into fecal pellets by zooplankton, they become part of the marine snow that settles through the water column. I'm working on a computer vision-based method to identify marine snow particles and estimate the carbon fluxes that they contribute in order to better constrain the ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle.

											Cara is a PhD student in Wildlife Science at Oregon State University and an affiliate with the US Forest Service. Her dissertation is focused on applications of machine learning to wildlife research and conservation, including passive acoustic monitoring for northern spotted owls and remote camera trap projects in Oregon and Malawi. Cara has a B.A. in environmental studies from the University of Washington and an M.S. in wildlife from Cal Poly Humboldt. In her free time, Cara likes to read and explore nature.

											<b>Project:</b> The Pacific Northwest of North America is one of the largest timber-producing regions in the world, and being able to effectively monitor forest biodiversity in the region is essential for management and conservation. The recent establishment of a large-scale bioacoustics monitoring program in the region, with thousands of sites visited every year, has laid the groundwork for complementary projects, including using remote cameras to survey forest wildlife communities. The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision model to identify wildlife species from camera trap images, using training data collected over several years from hundreds of sites in western Oregon.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											My name is Alba Márquez-Rodríguez, and I am a Computer Engineer from the University of Huelva. Combining my passion for computer science with my deep environmental awareness, I have discovered a strong interest in the intersection of technology and ecology. With a background in computer science, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to the field of Artificial Intelligence for conservation purposes. Through my involvement in environmental organizations and my current project at Doñana National Park, I am driven to make a positive impact on biodiversity conservation and promote the collection of non-invasive data for accurate monitoring.
										</p>
										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> I am currently working on an ongoing project titled "Automated census and biodiversity monitoring system using deep learning techniques." This project aims to develop a cutting-edge protocol and workflow for wildlife monitoring, leveraging camera trapping, citizen science, and Deep Learning. My role within the project involves creating a Neural Network for species classification using camera-trap images from Doñana National Park. By developing advanced techniques and optimizing code efficiency, our goal is to obtain unbiased estimates of species and community dynamics, enabling cost-effective and prompt responses to ecological changes. I am excited about the opportunity to further my knowledge and skills through the CV4Ecology Summer Workshop and contribute to the advancement of AI in ecology.

										 <i>Research scientist</i> 

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a contractor working with the Tulalip Tribes of Washington State, was previously a Research Scientist in the Prugh Lab at the University of Washington, completed a MSc in the Wildlife Coexistence Lab at the University of British Columbia, and obtained a BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado. My interests lie at the intersection of wildlife conservation and conflict mitigation, where I use novel analytical approaches to bridge the gaps between the biological sciences, land use policy planning, and wildlife management. When I’m out of office, I am likely prioritizing my mental health (planning backpacking trips and tattoos) and advocating for others to do the same (however they see fit—tattoos not necessary).
										</p>
										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> I am hopeful to work towards real-time human-wildlife conflict mitigation by developing predator detection models that can run in-house on satellite- or cellular-linked camera traps, processing images in real time and sending alerts to land and wildlife managers when predators enter areas of high potential conflict (e.g., recreation hotspots, agricultural landscapes).

										<i>University of Massachusetts, Amherst</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a Ph.D. student at UMASS Amherst in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology program. I study phenotypic and functional shifts resulting from rapid radiations in African cichlids and repeated evolution in Astyanax mexicanus cavefish. My focus is on curating and analyzing high-throughput behavioral and genetic data. Machine learning is a robust tool for processing high-throughput visual data, and I hope to utilize it throughout my career and collaborations. I dedicate myself to increasingly integrative and accessible science and seek to contribute to ecological and organismic health. In my personal time, I enjoy a good resource management game or mountainside picnics. If you see me around, I am always willing to find a good snack and talk about science. 										</p>
										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> As the importance of biodiversity is increasingly understood, so are the mechanisms by which it is created and maintained. Interactions between selective pressures across time and at every level of cellular organizations contribute to organismic traits. Our species of interest, Lake Malawi cichlids, display an impressive diversity in functional morphology within a relatively recent rapid radiation. We ask whether the genetic architectures surrounding the timing of kinetic behaviors in cichlid species contributed to—or supported—the levels of functional biodiversity seen in cichlid populations through temporal niche partitioning. If so, does the timing of kinetic behavior change given environmental cues like light, sediment, novel objects, or conspecific organisms?

										<i>University of New South Wales, Sydney</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a PhD candidate at UNSW Sydney, Australia, where I have integrated my passion for diving and underwater photography with my research by looking at the potential use of recreational dive photographs to monitor marine species and their habitats. As part of my research I created an iNaturalist project, <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/in-bygone-dives">In Bygone Dives</a> to collect old underwater photographs from the SCUBA diving community as a baseline for marine ecosystems from which to track change.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> My project is looking at the potential value of incidental data captured in the background of photographs as a source of data to monitor marine habitat distribution. Specifically, we hope to use photographs shared to iNaturalist, but rather than assessing the subject of the observations (i.e., fish) we plan to use computer vision to classify the reef captured incidentally in the background as an alternative technique for broad scale marine habitat mapping and monitoring.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I'm Sicily (they/them), a second-year PhD student at the University of Leeds in the Leverhulme Extinction Studies Program. My doctoral research focuses on the Asian Songbird Crisis as a phenomenon, particularly in the global songbird trade hotspot, Indonesia. I am a conservation biologist by training but have now shifted to a more interdisciplinary research focus, working across the various fields of conservation social science, political ecology, computer science and design. Outside of PhD life, I love playing football (Arsenal till I die!), bouldering and making silly little things at home like limoncello, candles and soap!										
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In Southeast Asia, hundreds of species of songbirds are sought after for singing competitions, breeding, prayer release, and as pets. However, the sheer diversity of species involved poses a fundamental challenge for identification and monitoring. The main project I will explore at the CV4Ecology Summer School is a machine learning-driven image classifier for species sold in bird marketplaces in East Asia, targeted at law enforcement through a mobile phone application. I am also interested to see if one or few-shot learning networks can be used for rare, data-poor species.

										<i>San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a Research Coordinator II at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. After completing my PhD in Behavioral Neuroscience at American University, I did postdoctoral research on elephant foraging behavior and gait analysis using CV tools at the Smithsonian National Zoo. This led me to my current position at SDZWA, where I apply a number of machine learning techniques to image processing and data analysis. I maintain AniML, a software package in Python and R for model training and species classification of camera trap images.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Species classification of camera trap images alone cannot tell us how many of that species are in a given area. I will be continuing the development of Uniqorn, our unsupervised clustering algorithm for re-identification of patterned species such as jaguars, tigers, and giraffes. This algorithm improves on current methods that require a human-labeled database for reference.

										<i>California Institute of Technology</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Roni is a postdoctoral research fellow working at the Dabiri Lab at Caltech. Motivated to unravel intricacies of fluid-structure interactions, she is studying visual data of vegetal kinematics resulting from wind loadings. The goal is to develop a wind speed prediction model from video footage of trees swaying in the wind. Before coming to Caltech, she completed her graduate studies at the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology where she focused on thermally driven atmospheric scale flows. More specifically, she focused on flows developing on mountains from diurnal solar heating.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> With wildfires more prevalent in the recent decades, firefighters could leverage aerial wind maps for fire mitigation purposes. This visual anemometry project leverages the dataset Roni collected in the last year. This dataset consists of both field and laboratory records that simultaneously sensed the wind with ultrasonic anemometers (on the ground) and the vegetal sway kinematics using an overhead camera. The field visual data was collected from a drone perspective, while the laboratory data was collected in a controlled wind tunnel using a stationary overhead camera.

										<i>Imperial College London</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Natalie is a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London, where she studies the behavioral ecology of leaf-cutter ants. Ants form societies that rival our own, and her research focuses on how they have coordinated complex behaviors to become dominant members of our planet. She holds a B.S. in Biology and Evolutionary Anthropology from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in Entomology from Pennsylvania State University. During her doctoral work studying the behavior of fungal-infected ‘zombie ants’, she developed an interest in computational methods for studying behavior. Broadly, she is passionate about preserving biodiversity and making science accessible for all.  
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Leaf-cutter ants form some of the largest and most complex social insect colonies, as millions of individuals work together to maintain a symbiotic fungus grown for food. Workers vary massively in size within a colony, but studying size variation proves tedious without automated methods. I aim to develop a scale-independent size detection tool that allows recognition of different sized workers in the field, as well as detects the leaf fragments they are carrying. This will improve our ability to study a major pest of the Neotropics, as well as improve monitoring of their consumption of different plants.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a third year PhD student here at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Sciences. My research involves studying interactions between human and natural systems through a suite of remote sensors. I am particularly interested in areas of data fusion and applying causal inference methods to better understand how we are affecting the landscape and vice versa. I hope to incorporate machine learning into my projects broadly. When I'm not working, you can find me surfing, fly-fishing, or on a long bike ride. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> My Summer CV project involves tracking bats in California's Central Valley using NEXRAD Doppler Weather Radar. My ultimate goal is seeing where these bats are spending time over the course of various time scales, from a single evening to decades, and exploring the relationship between where bats forage for pests and agricultural pesticide use.

										<i>Aarhus University</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											In my PhD project at Aarhus University, I develop methods for detecting interactions between flowers and pollinators using image-based monitoring, deep learning, and computer vision. More broadly, my interests are in developing technical solutions for automated nature monitoring to help us understand natural processes and how they are affected by e.g. climate change. I love turning an idea into a working product and will often use my skills in coding, electronics, CAD and 3D printing to get there. I strongly believe that interdisciplinary collaboration between ecology and engineering will move both fields forward.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In my project, I will test how well CNNs can detect and classify insect species that are morphologically different but belong to the same order. Deep learning methods are increasingly being applied in insect monitoring, but published insect detection models are generally confined to few species and are therefore very site-specific and not broadly applicable. At the same time, the laborious process of collecting and labelling sufficient amounts of training data and the computational power required to train CNNs may prevent ecologists from leveraging their power. The aim of this project is a publicly available, open source, generic insect detector.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											Coming from a town known for the mysterious cases of children killed by wolves, was drawn towards wildlife conservation after witnessing a pangolin trade incident. What started as a volunteering stint in wildlife awareness activities a decade back became a full-time involvement over the years in wildlife research and conservation activities. Was fortunate to have been part of the Nature Conservation Foundation’s IUCN ITHCP project in southern India where I contributed for outreach, applied conservation and wildlife corridor monitoring projects. With Chevening Leadership scholarship, I completed my MSc in Applied Ecology and Conservation from the University of EastAnglia in 2020 and now leading team for Tech4Conservation at the Habitats Trust.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> To explore the possibility of developing computer vision models for smartphone users while driving vehicle to help detect wild animals crossing road or waiting at the edge of the road. The broader idea is to establish a framework which enables collection of animal crossing behaviour on any road using a smartphone. Road networks are expanding at an alarming rate, cutting into pristine wildlife habitats and increasing wildlife-vehicle encounters, this approach will increase the data availability on such incidents and would help us in identifying sensitive road segments for wildlife crossings and prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am Francesca, I am a grad student in biology at Caltech studying neurobiology in fruit flies. I study flight control mechanisms flies use to maintain stable flight. Previously, I worked on a series of release-recapture experiments in the Mojave Desert studying how flies disperse in an open area. I grew up in Quito, Ecuador, then traveled to Florida for college at the University of Florida. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Long-distance dispersal is difficult to study in small insects, but with advances in remote sensor technologies, it is now possible to detect insects flying close to the ground. We performed release-and-recapture experiments using Drosophila and collected data to census the directional distribution of the flies as they disperse from a release site using sky-facing cameras. I seek to apply computer vision methods to these datasets to count the number of flies in each frame and track their trajectories as they move through the camera frame. This will inform existing models of how flies perform long-distance navigation, specially how they choose their initial headings while dispersing in an open landscape.

											Alixandra is a PhD student and Darwin Trust Scholar at the University of Edinburgh. As an undergraduate student at Columbia University, Alix developed a passion for non-lethal and non-invasive survey sampling methods, thus bringing her to her current work in acoustic monitoring. Her doctoral work focuses on how the flight sounds of the humble bumblebee can be used as a way to assess population dynamics–an especially pressing line of inquiry given that bumblebees are facing worldwide declines, and are important bioindicators. Alix is a firm believer that interdisciplinary collaboration can change the landscape of conservation ecology for the better, and she is excited to be an explorer of that horizon. She enjoys fire spinning and riding ponies across the Scottish moorlands in her spare time. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Bumblebees face global population declines. As important pollinators, ongoing monitoring of population size, geographic distribution, and demography (i.e. age, sex, size) is essential for risk assessment and conservation. Because insect surveys are labor-intensive, automated and remote survey techniques--like acoustic monitoring--are of increasing interest. Bumblebees are excellent candidates for remote acoustic monitoring due to their distinct flight, foraging, and behavioral sounds. Therefore, the goal of this summer research is to train an AI-based verification system that can identify species-diagnostic signatures in a continuous stream of real-time sounds. Such technology would be a boon to people in the agricultural sectors, conservationists, and hobbyists alike.

After graduating from college in 2008, she began a three-mile-per-hour tour—on foot—of the subtle and dramatic shifts of vegetation across the American landscape, hiking over 10,500 miles on National Scenic Trails. Rachel is a doctoral student at the Yale School of the Environment. She is fascinated by how soils translate climate into vegetation in drylands, and her favorite drylands are big sagebrush ecosystems. She is excited by the potential for combining traditional field data with artificial intelligence to answer fundamental and applied questions about plant community ecology.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In rangelands, gradients of grazing intensity and disturbance form around water sources, with the greatest (and most visible) impacts close to the source, termed the “piosphere”. Ranching practices draw upon a suite of attractants (including artificial water sources) to achieve more even use of forage across the landscape. Yet, data sources for these attractants are incomplete and inaccurate. My project will use computer vision to detect piospheres in Wyoming using aerial imagery. This project will provide critical data to identify water- and livestock-remote areas, with important applications for land management, conservation, and sample design for research (like mine) that addresses fundamental questions about the interacting roles of environmental factors and disturbance in determining dryland plant community structure and function.

											I am Felix Rustemeyer, a dutch-german graduate student from Maastricht University in the Netherlands. After conducting a bachelors in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, I am now finishing my masters in Data Science for Decision Making. Inspired by a minor in Geomatics during an exchange in Sweden, I have grown a passion for employing the power of deep learning and computer vision for raising awareness and tackling the issues of our time. In an internship role at the Stockholm Environment Institute, I have conducted this last semester by using deep learning for identifying the impact of permafrost thaw. I am honored to be part of the inaugural cohort of the CV4Ecology summer school and am extremely excited for August!
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Thawing permafrost is a huge problem as permafrost soils are heavily carbon rich and is therefore causing large amounts of GHG emissions, while being absent from many international dialogues and strategies aimed at tackling climate change. The Stockholm Environment Institute has established a cross-sector collaboration to fill in this knowledge gap. The goal of this project is to identify landscape indications of thawing permafrost in the arctic using computer vision and satellite imagery. By identifying and monitoring these landscape indications in the form of thaw slumps, the extent, increase and the impact on climate caused by thawing permafrost in the arctic can be estimated.

											Taiki is a contractor at NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center working in the Acoustic Ecology Lab. There he works with researchers who use passive acoustic monitoring to study marine mammals off the coast of California. His main focus is building free, open-source software tools that make it easier to analyze passive acoustic data. His favorite animals are beaked whales and frogfish because they are adorable weirdos. When he’s not behind a computer, you can find him hiking, climbing rocks, or playing with his dog, Noodle.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Beaked whales are deep diving marine mammals that are difficult to study using traditional visual methods because of how little time they spend at the surface. During their long foraging dives they make echolocation clicks which can be uniquely identified to different beaked whale species, which makes them an ideal candidate to study using passive acoustics. In this project we will create images of echolocation clicks using the Wigner-Ville transform and attempt to classify them to species.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a quantitative ecologist and Presidential Postdoc Fellow in EEB at Michigan State University (as of August 2022). My research uses a range of quantitative approaches that synthesize large-scale data streams to address both basic and applied questions in population and community ecology. I seek to understand how and why ecological systems are responding to rapid climatic change and what this might tell us regarding how best to conserve these systems. I have a particular interest in the timing of seasonal events (phenology), population dynamics, and biodiversity.

											<b>Project:</b> The Pacific walrus is an important benthic predator in Arctic marine ecosystems and a species of substantial cultural and economic importance to many Indigenous Arctic coastal communities. As a result of increasing pressures associated with global change, the future of this species is highly uncertain. I aim to develop a deep learning-based classifier to identify walrus in satellite imagery. This will serve as the basis for large-scale, automated efforts to monitor the distribution and abundance of this species and will provide stakeholders with information needed to make timely conservation management decisions.
