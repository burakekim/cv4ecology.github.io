											I'm a PhD student in the Ocean Sciences department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My doctoral research focuses on using computational methods to estimate the rates at which carbon is cycled in the ocean, but I'm broadly interested in applying data-driven methods to solve problems in the natural environment. Before venturing into oceanography, I studied civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> The ocean influences the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, partly due to a network of biologically mediated processes known as the biological carbon pump. Photosynthetic algae fix CO2 into biomass in the surface ocean. As algal cells collide and coalesce into aggregates or are repackaged into fecal pellets by zooplankton, they become part of the marine snow that settles through the water column. I'm working on a computer vision-based method to identify marine snow particles and estimate the carbon fluxes that they contribute in order to better constrain the ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> The Pacific Northwest of North America is one of the largest timber-producing regions in the world, and being able to effectively monitor forest biodiversity in the region is essential for management and conservation. The recent establishment of a large-scale bioacoustics monitoring program in the region, with thousands of sites visited every year, has laid the groundwork for complementary projects, including using remote cameras to survey forest wildlife communities. The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision model to identify wildlife species from camera trap images, using training data collected over several years from hundreds of sites in western Oregon.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											My name is Alba Márquez-Rodríguez, and I am a Computer Engineer from the University of Huelva. Combining my passion for computer science with my deep environmental awareness, I have discovered a strong interest in the intersection of technology and ecology. With a background in computer science, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to the field of Artificial Intelligence for conservation purposes. Through my involvement in environmental organizations and my current project at Doñana National Park, I am driven to make a positive impact on biodiversity conservation and promote the collection of non-invasive data for accurate monitoring.
										</p>
										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> I am currently working on an ongoing project titled "Automated census and biodiversity monitoring system using deep learning techniques." This project aims to develop a cutting-edge protocol and workflow for wildlife monitoring, leveraging camera trapping, citizen science, and Deep Learning. My role within the project involves creating a Neural Network for species classification using camera-trap images from Doñana National Park. By developing advanced techniques and optimizing code efficiency, our goal is to obtain unbiased estimates of species and community dynamics, enabling cost-effective and prompt responses to ecological changes. I am excited about the opportunity to further my knowledge and skills through the CV4Ecology Summer Workshop and contribute to the advancement of AI in ecology.

										 <i>Research scientist</i> 

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a contractor working with the Tulalip Tribes of Washington State, was previously a Research Scientist in the Prugh Lab at the University of Washington, completed a MSc in the Wildlife Coexistence Lab at the University of British Columbia, and obtained a BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado. My interests lie at the intersection of wildlife conservation and conflict mitigation, where I use novel analytical approaches to bridge the gaps between the biological sciences, land use policy planning, and wildlife management. When I’m out of office, I am likely prioritizing my mental health (planning backpacking trips and tattoos) and advocating for others to do the same (however they see fit—tattoos not necessary).
										</p>
										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> I am hopeful to work towards real-time human-wildlife conflict mitigation by developing predator detection models that can run in-house on satellite- or cellular-linked camera traps, processing images in real time and sending alerts to land and wildlife managers when predators enter areas of high potential conflict (e.g., recreation hotspots, agricultural landscapes).

										<i>University of Massachusetts, Amherst</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a Ph.D. student at UMASS Amherst in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology program. I study phenotypic and functional shifts resulting from rapid radiations in African cichlids and repeated evolution in Astyanax mexicanus cavefish. My focus is on curating and analyzing high-throughput behavioral and genetic data. Machine learning is a robust tool for processing high-throughput visual data, and I hope to utilize it throughout my career and collaborations. I dedicate myself to increasingly integrative and accessible science and seek to contribute to ecological and organismic health. In my personal time, I enjoy a good resource management game or mountainside picnics. If you see me around, I am always willing to find a good snack and talk about science. 										</p>
										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> As the importance of biodiversity is increasingly understood, so are the mechanisms by which it is created and maintained. Interactions between selective pressures across time and at every level of cellular organizations contribute to organismic traits. Our species of interest, Lake Malawi cichlids, display an impressive diversity in functional morphology within a relatively recent rapid radiation. We ask whether the genetic architectures surrounding the timing of kinetic behaviors in cichlid species contributed to—or supported—the levels of functional biodiversity seen in cichlid populations through temporal niche partitioning. If so, does the timing of kinetic behavior change given environmental cues like light, sediment, novel objects, or conspecific organisms?

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a PhD candidate at UNSW Sydney, Australia, where I have integrated my passion for diving and underwater photography with my research by looking at the potential use of recreational dive photographs to monitor marine species and their habitats. As part of my research I created an iNaturalist project, <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/in-bygone-dives">In Bygone Dives</a> to collect old underwater photographs from the SCUBA diving community as a baseline for marine ecosystems from which to track change.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> My project is looking at the potential value of incidental data captured in the background of photographs as a source of data to monitor marine habitat distribution. Specifically, we hope to use photographs shared to iNaturalist, but rather than assessing the subject of the observations (i.e., fish) we plan to use computer vision to classify the reef captured incidentally in the background as an alternative technique for broad scale marine habitat mapping and monitoring.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I'm Sicily (they/them), a second-year PhD student at the University of Leeds in the Leverhulme Extinction Studies Program. My doctoral research focuses on the Asian Songbird Crisis as a phenomenon, particularly in the global songbird trade hotspot, Indonesia. I am a conservation biologist by training but have now shifted to a more interdisciplinary research focus, working across the various fields of conservation social science, political ecology, computer science and design. Outside of PhD life, I love playing football (Arsenal till I die!), bouldering and making silly little things at home like limoncello, candles and soap!										
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In Southeast Asia, hundreds of species of songbirds are sought after for singing competitions, breeding, prayer release, and as pets. However, the sheer diversity of species involved poses a fundamental challenge for identification and monitoring. The main project I will explore at the CV4Ecology Summer School is a machine learning-driven image classifier for species sold in bird marketplaces in East Asia, targeted at law enforcement through a mobile phone application. I am also interested to see if one or few-shot learning networks can be used for rare, data-poor species.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a Research Coordinator II at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. After completing my PhD in Behavioral Neuroscience at American University, I did postdoctoral research on elephant foraging behavior and gait analysis using CV tools at the Smithsonian National Zoo. This led me to my current position at SDZWA, where I apply a number of machine learning techniques to image processing and data analysis. I maintain AniML, a software package in Python and R for model training and species classification of camera trap images.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Species classification of camera trap images alone cannot tell us how many of that species are in a given area. I will be continuing the development of Uniqorn, our unsupervised clustering algorithm for re-identification of patterned species such as jaguars, tigers, and giraffes. This algorithm improves on current methods that require a human-labeled database for reference.

										<i>Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) (at the Department of Wildlife, Fish and Environmental Studies) in Umeå, Sweden. In my current research, I apply technologies around camera trapping and AI as well as citizen science to study ecological questions related to wildlife conservation and management. Before starting my post-doc at SLU, I conducted my PhD at the Netherlands Institute for Ecology. I investigated the reproductive ecology of inland breeding oystercatchers by studying the main drivers of the reduced reproductive success in the breeding area itself as well as potential carry-over effects of winter condition on the performance in the breeding season on a large national scale. In general, I have an academic background in reproduction and quantitative ecology with a strong interest in movement, population and conservation ecology. My research is characterized by combining citizen science, advanced statistical methods and different monitoring techniques/technology to study large-scale ecological relationships. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b>I am involved in the Viltbild program, where SLU collaborates with the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management. With Viltbild, we develop a platform to collect and organise camera-trapping images taken by hunters all over Sweden. On a long-term, this can serve as a digital monitoring tool to monitor Swedish game species with the help of hunters. During the CV4E summer workshop I will work on building algorithms that can distinguish sex and age (juveniles, adults) on camera trap images from five ungulate species (occurring in Sweden). An automatic identification of sex and age can help us to estimate reproductive performance and in turn result in a quicker feedback loop between monitoring and management, leading to management that is more appropriate.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											My professional journey has led me from hands-on forestry work to the intricate world of research, currently delving into the exciting realm of data analysis and computer vision in the field of ecology. I'm driven by the thrill of solving data puzzles and answering research questions using state-of-the-art open source tools and programming. My prior experience involves working with a dedicated team of pollination ecologists, aiding them with R programming for their research. The current focus of my research work is an AI project that aims to automate data collection on plant-pollinator interactions.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b>  Pollination is critical to many ecosystem services and to human nutrition. Currently, pollination ecologists spend countless hours collecting, killing and then identifying pollinators in the lab in order to acquire enough data to understand plant-pollinator interactions and their change across environmental gradients and anthropogenic disturbances. Such expensive data collection approaches could be automated by using novel tools from technology and computer vision. The key question driving my work is: "How can we optimally harness the power of AI to automatically collect and analyze data and images of how plants and pollinators interact?"

											I'm a master's student in the Horticulture department at OSU with a BA in International Area Studies from New College of Florida and a BS from OSU in Botany. In between degrees I've worked as an English teacher, furniture maker, copywriter, and backcountry botanist. My interests in design, field ecology, and data science intersect at the development of techniques for automated insect monitoring. Off the job I'll be woodworking, fly fishing, looking at plants, or keeping our old trucks running.
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Pollinator health is critical to the maintenance of agricultural and ecological systems, though our current methods for surveying pollinators are resource-intensive and data-poor. Developing a method for continuous, long-term monitoring of pollinator activity could improve understanding of species distributions, pollinator guilds, and how population dynamics are affected by stressors such as human impact and climate change. I'm working to use Deep Learning techniques to effectively process images from automated insect camera traps.

											<b>Project:</b> Diversity of phytoplankton is essential for Marine ecosystems' processes (production of organic matter, pelagic food webs, carbon pump) and fate of these processes depends critically on phytoplankton community structure. It is thus important to investigate how changing physical and chemical sea conditions due to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures impact the phytoplankton physiology and community structure and thus disrupt the marine ecosystem and its functions. The aim is to develop a computer vision system that can automatically identify and count phytoplankton species of interest, estimate cell size and calculate the biovolume of the specimen.

											Michaela (she/her/hers) is a PhD student and NDSEG Fellow at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Her dissertation research focuses on applying novel machine learning tools to improve underwater acoustics data processing. Trained as a marine mammal biologist, Michaela’s core research goals are to understand cetacean (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) behavior, distribution, and foraging ecology, using acoustics. To do just this, Michaela is excited about applying computer vision tools to detect and classify unique cetacean signal types in spectrograms. When she’s not listening to whale songs or wrestling matlab and python, you can usually find her surfing or swimming nearby. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Blue whales come to Southern California in the summer to forage on dense patches of microscopic krill. While in the region, they produce low-frequency foraging, social, and reproductive calls. Using bottom-moored acoustic sensors, we have a long-term record of their singing behavior at multiple sights, giving us insight into their seasonal, diel, and interannual behavioral patterns. However, given the large volumes of data we collect, detection of blue whale songs is like finding needles in a haystack. There is currently no reliable method to detect and classify highly variable blue whale social and foraging calls. For CV4Ecology, Michaela is bringing a training dataset of blue whale call spectrograms in an effort to develop a robust deep learning model that is capable of detecting and classifying complex, highly variable, northeastern pacific blue whale calls in passive acoustic data.

											Hi I’m Ben, a PhD student at UCL and ZSL in the UK, supported by the Fisheries Society of the British Isles. My PhD is focused on leveraging machine-learning to monitor and support coral reef conservation. This is in close cooperation with my industry partner Mars, who operate the world’s largest coral reef restoration program (buildingcoral.com). I have a strong background in marine biology and have enjoyed the continued opportunity to boost my skillset in machine learning over the course of my PhD.

											<b>Project:</b> The soundscape of coral reefs is a rich and diverse symphony of different noises. An increasing body of research has shown there is much we can learn about the state of these habitats by listening. Machine learning presents the cutting edge in similar domains, but is so far underutilized on reef soundscapes. My project aims to utilize a large and diverse dataset of reef soundscape recordings from across the tropics to develop a first prototype of a foundational model that can be used as a springboard for ML led analysis of reef acoustic data. This model should enable users to extract domain specific feature embeddings from reef audio, enabling the training of unsupervised clustering algorithms or shallow classifiers with most of the time and compute cost removed.

											Alixandra is a PhD student and Darwin Trust Scholar at the University of Edinburgh. As an undergraduate student at Columbia University, Alix developed a passion for non-lethal and non-invasive survey sampling methods, thus bringing her to her current work in acoustic monitoring. Her doctoral work focuses on how the flight sounds of the humble bumblebee can be used as a way to assess population dynamics–an especially pressing line of inquiry given that bumblebees are facing worldwide declines, and are important bioindicators. Alix is a firm believer that interdisciplinary collaboration can change the landscape of conservation ecology for the better, and she is excited to be an explorer of that horizon. She enjoys fire spinning and riding ponies across the Scottish moorlands in her spare time. 
										</p>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> Bumblebees face global population declines. As important pollinators, ongoing monitoring of population size, geographic distribution, and demography (i.e. age, sex, size) is essential for risk assessment and conservation. Because insect surveys are labor-intensive, automated and remote survey techniques--like acoustic monitoring--are of increasing interest. Bumblebees are excellent candidates for remote acoustic monitoring due to their distinct flight, foraging, and behavioral sounds. Therefore, the goal of this summer research is to train an AI-based verification system that can identify species-diagnostic signatures in a continuous stream of real-time sounds. Such technology would be a boon to people in the agricultural sectors, conservationists, and hobbyists alike.

Rachel is a doctoral student at the Yale School of the Environment. She is fascinated by how soils translate climate into vegetation in drylands, and her favorite drylands are big sagebrush ecosystems. She is excited by the potential for combining traditional field data with artificial intelligence to answer fundamental and applied questions about plant community ecology.

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											<b>Project:</b> In rangelands, gradients of grazing intensity and disturbance form around water sources, with the greatest (and most visible) impacts close to the source, termed the “piosphere”. Ranching practices draw upon a suite of attractants (including artificial water sources) to achieve more even use of forage across the landscape. Yet, data sources for these attractants are incomplete and inaccurate. My project will use computer vision to detect piospheres in Wyoming using aerial imagery. This project will provide critical data to identify water- and livestock-remote areas, with important applications for land management, conservation, and sample design for research (like mine) that addresses fundamental questions about the interacting roles of environmental factors and disturbance in determining dryland plant community structure and function.

Inspired by a minor in Geomatics during an exchange in Sweden, I have grown a passion for employing the power of deep learning and computer vision for raising awareness and tackling the issues of our time. In an internship role at the Stockholm Environment Institute, I have conducted this last semester by using deep learning for identifying the impact of permafrost thaw. I am honored to be part of the inaugural cohort of the CV4Ecology summer school and am extremely excited for August!

											<b>Project:</b> Thawing permafrost is a huge problem as permafrost soils are heavily carbon rich and is therefore causing large amounts of GHG emissions, while being absent from many international dialogues and strategies aimed at tackling climate change. The Stockholm Environment Institute has established a cross-sector collaboration to fill in this knowledge gap. The goal of this project is to identify landscape indications of thawing permafrost in the arctic using computer vision and satellite imagery. By identifying and monitoring these landscape indications in the form of thaw slumps, the extent, increase and the impact on climate caused by thawing permafrost in the arctic can be estimated.

During their long foraging dives they make echolocation clicks which can be uniquely identified to different beaked whale species, which makes them an ideal candidate to study using passive acoustics. In this project we will create images of echolocation clicks using the Wigner-Ville transform and attempt to classify them to species.

										<i>University of Montana Spatial Analysis Lab</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am an analyst and field coordinator for the University of Montana Spatial Analysis Lab in. After earning my Bachelors degree in Environmental Studies from University of Vermont in 2019, I worked on geospatial scientific computing and imaging spectroscopy at Arizona State University. My work there involved mapping coral reefs, foliar functional trait mapping, and survey design for marine biodiversity monitoring. I then spent a winter season working with Glacier National Park's Citizen Science program helping to create wildlife surveys and analytical products for improving park management and visitor experience. I am interested in spatial ecology, land system science, algorithm development, and machine learning.

											<b>Project:</b> We are working to characterize woodland draws and ravines across a huge area of Eastern Montana and the Dakotas in conjunction with the Bureau of Land Management. These systems are critical for wildlife and grazing, and are vital to the health of the region and function of its agriculture industry. These systems are particularly difficult to monitor due to their narrow, dendritic shape, so we will be using computer vision methods and remote sensing to develop a scalable monitoring protocol.

										<i>Michigan State University (as of Aug 1, 2022)</i>

										<p class="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">
											I am a quantitative ecologist and Presidential Postdoc Fellow in EEB at Michigan State University (as of August 2022). My research uses a range of quantitative approaches that synthesize large-scale data streams to address both basic and applied questions in population and community ecology. I seek to understand how and why ecological systems are responding to rapid climatic change and what this might tell us regarding how best to conserve these systems. I have a particular interest in the timing of seasonal events (phenology), population dynamics, and biodiversity.

											<b>Project:</b> The Pacific walrus is an important benthic predator in Arctic marine ecosystems and a species of substantial cultural and economic importance to many Indigenous Arctic coastal communities. As a result of increasing pressures associated with global change, the future of this species is highly uncertain. I aim to develop a deep learning-based classifier to identify walrus in satellite imagery. This will serve as the basis for large-scale, automated efforts to monitor the distribution and abundance of this species and will provide stakeholders with information needed to make timely conservation management decisions.
